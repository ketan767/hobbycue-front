            During one of the ‚Äòparenting lecture‚Äô sessions with my daughter, I
            was trying to make her appreciate a balance in her daily routine
            addressing her learning, creativity, health, fitness, social and
            mental aspects. It was an extempore speech at that time, but I got
            curious about the idea and did some research that turned out to be a
            really interesting journey for me. There have been so many closely
            related fields of study‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI have just summarized some of them for
            you to draw your own inspiration ‚Ä¶
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>The closest framework was the Wellness Wheel</p>

          <p>
            I have also seen versions with 7 or 6 sections. This is often done
            by combining the Financial aspect with Occupational. Environmental
            may also get dropped or get associated with Social.

              A popular way to check for balance is to imagine these segments to
              be the spokes of a wheel. Colour in each segment based on your
              level of satisfaction out of 10. Now look at the wheel ‚Ä¶ would it
              be a smooth ride or a bumpy one? Use this to figure out where to
              focus your energy on trying to obtain more peace and happiness.

                A typical day for most people involves four kinds of activities
                as depicted here. But the scope for experimentation is perhaps
                the highest through the use of ‚Äòfree time‚Äô. One can go beyond
                relaxation and casual activities to ‚Äòserious leisure‚Äô pursuits
                including hobbies, side projects, volunteering and amateur work.
                And many of these will cater to one or more forms of wellness
                and balance.

                about <strong>Social</strong> as well. It is often said that
                human beings are social animals‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour thoughts and actions

            For best results, these aspects need to be included in our daily
            lives. There are also frameworks on the approach to balance and
            wellness, but maybe that‚Äôs for another day. As mentioned earlier, I
