              <p>
                Simply put, hobbycue has Cues for your Hobby üôÇ It is a
                community blog for sharing your experiences and learning from
                each other. Hobbies are categorised, and a Cue could be in the
                form of a blog, a reference to a teacher/coach, an
                equipment/part supplier, etc. ‚Äì all pertaining to the hobby. In
                this website you can jump across hobby categories or simply
                search for Cues. Check the About page for a basic why and what.
                We‚Äôll soon have a post with more details.

              <h3>How are hobbies organised?</h3>
              <p>
                To make it easier, hobbies in hobbycue are categorised based on
                research work done by Dr. Robert Stebbins called ‚ÄòSerious
                Leisure‚Äô. If you find anything missing or incorrect, do let us
                know. Do note that we are still in a beta phase of this whole
                concept and happy to fine tune all content.
